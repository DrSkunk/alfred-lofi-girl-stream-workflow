# Lofi girl music stream

An Alfred 4 workflow that plays the Lofi Girl "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to" livestream.  
Uses [MPV](https://mpv.io/). Depending on how you install MPV, you may need to adjust the path in the script.

For example, when you installed it with brew, change

```sh
export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```
to
```sh
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
```
